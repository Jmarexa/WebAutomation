# OpenBrowser Project

This project is a Maven-based Java application designed for browser automation and testing using **Selenium**, **TestNG**, and **Cucumber**. It includes dependencies for reporting and test management with **ExtentReports**.

## Features

- **Selenium Integration**: Automate browser interactions.
- **TestNG**: Framework for running test cases and generating test reports.
- **Cucumber**: Behavior-driven development (BDD) testing using Gherkin syntax.
- **ExtentReports**: Generate rich, interactive test reports.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher.
2. **Apache Maven**: Version 3.6 or higher.
3. **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred Java IDE.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd OpenBrowser
   ```

2. Build the project:

## Usage

1. Update the browser driver paths in your test configurations.
2. Run the tests using TestNG:
